# comp163-assignment-4

This game shows the experience of a college student trying to balance coursework, study habits, social life, and stress. The player selects a course load and study focus, and the program updates GPA, study hours, social points, and stress level to reflect the consequences of their decisions. I used if/elif/else in test case 2 to branch between light, standard, and heavy course loads. I also had nested if statements in test case 2 that checked the users GPA before increasing study hours and stress based on course load. I used if/elif/else and nested if statements in test case 3 which allowed the user to pick what they want to study and based on new stats then it prints recommendations for the user. You can run it in a python compiler/interpreter then input answers when asked and watch how user stats change by the end of the game. Ending 1: Tells the user that they have a balanced life. Ending 2: tells the user they have a low social engagement. Ending 3: tells the user they have a high social life. I did not use AI but I did go to office hours to get help from a TA and conversed with my friend who has the same class. Ending 4: States that stats from the game are unclear and to check inputs.
